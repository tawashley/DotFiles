# Dotfiles
> A set of files to help setup a clean machine

The structure and base set of files here are heavily inspired by [Paul Irish's](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) own dotfiles, along with code picked and plucked from various areas to create something that is just right with my picky system setup

## TODO

- [x] Add in 'Spectacle.app' preferences
- [ ] Add in 'Path Finder.app' preferences
- [x] Add VS Code to path
- [x] Copy over iTerm 2 Solarised colour scheme
- [ ] Create `.vscode`
  - [ ] Add all VS extensions using `code --install-extension {name}`
  - [ ] Copy over `vs-code/settings.json` to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
  - [ ] Copy over `vs-code/keybindings.json` to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
- [ ] Consider copying all files into `~/dotfiles` and symlinking individual files
- [ ] Sort out install strategy - git-less command
