# Dotfiles
> A set of files to help setup a clean machine

The structure and base set of files here are heavily inspired by [Paul Irish's](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) own dotfiles, along with code picked and plucked from various areas to create something that is just right with my picky system setup

## No git? Not problem

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/tawashley/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1
```
